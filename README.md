# Work-trader
There are 2 parts to this project. The first part is for me to learn deep learning and to implement neural networks from scratch. The second part is to learn reinforcement learning and apply and evaluate various techniques to teach an agent to trade.

## Creating Neural Networks with Python/Keras/Tensorflow to Predict the Future
I wanted to first try to predict prices given the current, high, low prices and volume. To aid my learning process, I created 3 versions with the same purpose, one using primitive numpy package and out-of-the-box python code to implement a neural network, and the second version using high-level frameworks (Keras) and the third version using Tensorflow.

> All 3 versions follow this architecture:
4 Layers, **Relu Activation Function** for first (n-1) layers, with last layer being **linear output**.
