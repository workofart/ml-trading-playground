## Creating Neural Networks with Python/Keras/Tensorflow to Predict the Future
I wanted to first try to predict prices given the current, high, low prices and volume. To aid my learning process, I created 3 versions with the same purpose, one using primitive numpy package and out-of-the-box python code to implement a neural network, and the second version using high-level frameworks (Keras) and the third version using Tensorflow.

> All 3 versions follow this architecture:
4 Layers, **Relu Activation Function** for first (n-1) layers, with last layer being **linear output**.
